## Description


## API Documentation
- Link to the Notion API Document (Notion Page Object):
  https://developers.notion.com/reference/page
  - This API could be used as a part of our main UI since note-taking is one of the main feature of our service.
  - Furthermore, using this API, any note typed on our interface will be automatically synced with Notion in real-time.
  - This API is the one demonstrated in the Java file provided.


- Link to the Quercus (Canvas) API:
  https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/
  - This API could be used to retrieve individual assignments and corresponding deadlines to be displayed on out main UI. 


- Link to the repository for Pomodoro Time Management API https://github.com/jordanch/pomodoro
  - This API could be an extra feature to provide Pomodoro Time management.
  - This is a potential side feature to me implemented.
