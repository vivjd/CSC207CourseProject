## Problem Domain


## Description
This study program will be a combination of multiple different productivity tools we have right now. Features we plan on implementing:
- **Note taking:** users can write notes on our program and save them to Notion.
- **To-do list:** users can create their own tasks and mark them off to keep track of their priorities and progress.
- **Assignment Tracker:** students can import their assignment dates and keep track of each assignment's deadline using a calendar. In the calendar, users could potentially add other important events. 
- **Quiz Generator:** using the notes the user writes, the program can generate a quiz for them to take. This quiz will be reworded and have different types of questions (e.g. short response, multiple choice, fill in the blank, etc). Once the user is done, the quiz will be automatically graded and provide answers to them. The answers may also point to certain parts of the user's notes to show them what to review 
- **Flashcard Generator:** users can create their own flashcards for them to study off of. 
- **Time Management:** users can use the Pomodoro technique to study. They can customize the length of the study and break periods.
- **Study with Friends:** users can friend others and keep each other in check. People can look at their friend's stats and they can compete to see how productive they are throughout the week.

## API Documentation
- Link to the Notion API Document (Notion Page Object):
  https://developers.notion.com/reference/page
  - This API could be used as a part of our main UI since note-taking is one of the main feature of our service.
  - Furthermore, using this API, any note typed on our interface will be automatically synced with Notion in real-time.
  - This API is the one demonstrated in the Java file provided.


- Link to the Quercus (Canvas) API:
  https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/
  - This API could be used to retrieve individual assignments and corresponding deadlines to be displayed on out main UI. 


- Link to the repository for Pomodoro Time Management API https://github.com/jordanch/pomodoro
  - This API could be an extra feature to provide Pomodoro Time management.
  - This is a potential side feature to me implemented.
